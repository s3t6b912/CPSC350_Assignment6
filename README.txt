Assignment 6 - Sorting

References:
1. You for showing us the sorting algorithms
2. The book (Yes I read)

How to run:
Change to src directory
Type make in the command line to run
Then ./Assignment6.out filename
filename is subbed for the name of the file you want to sort

Notes:
1. I included all five sorting algorithms
2. The program doesn't print out the sorted collection, just the time that it takes to complete each one because the instructions didn't say to print it out and it wouldn't look very pretty if a large collection is used
